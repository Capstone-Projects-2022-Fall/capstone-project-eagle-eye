# System Overview
Eagle Eye is a simple, easy to use tennis line call system that is deployed while playing to track the ball and make automated line calls. The Eagle Eye system consists of a camera or recording device and the application installed on a laptop. The camera can be mounted on one end of the court on either a tripod or a mount attached to the surrounding fence of a tennis court. Connected to the camera is an HDMI to USB capture card which converts the cameras HDMI signal to a USB signal that the laptop can use. The laptop is running the Eagle Eye program and serves as both the live feed monitor that displays what it is seeing and the speed of each shot and the audio output device for the audible cues for when a ball is determined to be out. The Eagle Eye app will handle the flight tracking and speed calculations for the ball, make judgements on whether the ball flies out-of-bounds, and present the video feed and calculations for the user.
