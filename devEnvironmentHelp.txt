Local machines will need to have the apps nvidia cuda and nvidia cuDNN installed. The nvidia cuDNN requires a developer account, this is easy and free to sign up for with your temple email.

If you want the libraries loccally (excluding the apps nvidia cuda and nvidia cuDNN) then here are the pip installs you need, pip default saves to c:\users\[you]\appdata\local\progras\python\python310\lib\site-packages for the latest version of pip.
Use GitBash to use pip
Use $ pip show [library name] to find where the libraries are if the path above doesn't work.

$ python.exe -m pip install --update pip
$ pip install tensorflow
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install opencv-python
$ pip install pydot
$ pip install graphviz
